        * Send patch upstream to Snap maintainers about registering Ubuntu Touch as a possible core system (for fixing CUPS on Ubuntu Touch via Snap)
        * polkit agent finished

    Ratchanan
        * Discuss upowerd patch with upowerd people (implementation details, back and forth)

    Mike
        * Draft release announcement of OTA-3, ping people about publishing the information
        * Identified problem: We still encourage people to report their Ubuntu Touch issues on https://github.com/ubports/ubuntu-touch, this workflow needs to be revisited and adjusted.

    Muhammad
        * FP4, work on locked boot loader support
        * Does Fairphone support "custom-signing key" -> No
        * Volla ships UT with boot loader unlocked, because the rootfs would still be unsigned, so no big security gain
        * Discussion about pros/cons of having a working secure boot chain vs. not, technical detail discussion
        * porting work OnePlus One, getting polished now, candidate for stable for 20.04 OTA-4
        * some other bits of work...
